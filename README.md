# Hey, I'm Xhibril 👋

I'm an undergrad student who mainly codes in **Java** and works on backend development.  
Right now, I'm focusing on building stuff with **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**, and I'm learning a bit of **React** for the frontend.  
I’ve also worked with **JavaFX** for small desktop apps and UI projects.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Java, a bit of C++
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, JDBC, MySQL
- **Frontend:** React (learning), JavaFX (basic)
- **Tools:** Gradle, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA
- **Concepts:** MVC pattern, DAO, REST APIs, database-driven apps

---

## 🧩 Projects
- **[Bookify](https://github.com/xhibril/Bookify)** — A JavaFX + MySQL app for booking and managing slots with login/signup.
- **[Spendly](#)** — A budgeting app I’m building with Spring Boot + React (still in progress).
- **[MiniProjects](https://github.com/xhibril/miniProjects)** — Small Java projects to practice core logic, DB handling, and clean structure.

## 🎯 What I'm Doing Now
- Learning **Spring Boot** and building proper backend structure (controllers, services, repositories)
- Getting comfortable with **React** basics and frontend setup
- Working on more backend-heavy projects to get job-ready
